I'm a professional software engineer with a background primarily in web development. I've worked on AWS, Microsoft Teams, and a few other products at large tech companies. Aside from web dev I'm also passionate about self-hosting, open source, and security. Note that the opinions expressed on this blog are my own and do not represent my employer.

Outside of work I'm super into music, coffee, keyboards, and video games.
